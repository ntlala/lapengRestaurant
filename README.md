Project Name: Restaurant Menu and Cart System
Project Description:
This project is a simple yet dynamic web application designed for a restaurant's menu system with a cart feature. It allows users to browse a categorized menu, view item details, and add items to their cart. The cart is displayed in a sidebar that can be toggled, showing the selected items, their quantities, and the total cost. The application includes a smooth user experience with interactive features like real-time cart updates and item quantity adjustments.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The application is built with Bootstrap to ensure that it is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Interactive Cart: Users can easily add items to their cart, view the cart in a sidebar, and modify item quantities (increase or decrease).
Real-time Cart Updates: The cart updates in real-time, providing instant feedback on the number of items and total price.
Notification System: When an item is added to the cart, a brief notification is displayed to confirm the action.
Checkout Option: Users can proceed with checkout and place their orders, with a message confirming successful orders.
Fixed Cart Button: The cart button is fixed at the top right of the screen, easily accessible from anywhere on the page.
Category-Based Menu: The menu is categorized into sections (Special Dishes, Special Drinks, Special Desserts), with each section containing a list of items and their prices.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the content of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling and layout of the menu, cart, and notifications.
JavaScript: For dynamic interaction, such as adding items to the cart and updating cart totals.
Bootstrap: For responsive layout and components (such as buttons, forms, etc.).
Font Awesome: For icons (e.g., shopping cart icon).
Future Enhancements:
User Authentication: Implementing a login system for users to track their orders and preferences.
Payment Gateway Integration: Enabling users to make payments directly through the site.
Admin Panel: Adding an admin panel for restaurant staff to update the menu, prices, and availability of items.
Search Functionality: Adding a search bar to help users quickly find menu items.
Deployment:
This application can be deployed easily using platforms such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for static hosting. A backend can be added in the future if needed to handle orders, user data, and more.

Target Audience:
This web application is designed for restaurants or food services looking to provide an interactive menu experience to customers. It can be used for small or medium-sized restaurants offering online browsing of their menu.
